1. Persistent subscriber IDs
	When a process is restarted it's given a new id, when it should be given the previous id associated with the task.
	This should probably be based on client name instead of ID.
DONE

2. Memory leak
	When publisher runs without subscriber, memory never gets released
DONE

3. c++ client, add overload function that takes ip and port instead of creating a channel in the app main function.

4. python using multiprocessing shm, does not unlink shm and suspects a leak on program exit.  try using posix_ipc
DONE

5. make grpc generated python modules part of cmake if possible.

6. When a subscriber unexpectedly crashes, how will the system know the number of subscribers is decremented?
	Possible solution: make derived publisher and subscriber from the client where the destructor unsubsribes
